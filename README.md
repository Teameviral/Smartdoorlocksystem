## Features:
The smart door lock system offers the following features:

1. Remote Access: Users can control the door lock remotely through a custom mobile application, providing convenience and flexibility.
2. Secure Authentication: The system supports multiple authentication methods such as password-based authentication and fingerprint recognition to ensure secure access to the door.
3. Real-time Monitoring: Users receive real-time notifications on their mobile devices when the door is locked or unlocked, enhancing security and peace of mind.
4. Access Logs: The system keeps track of access logs, recording the date, time, and method of access. This feature enables users to monitor door activity and review access history.
5. Emergency Override: In case of emergencies, the system includes an emergency override feature, allowing authorized individuals to bypass the lock manually.
6. Low Power Consumption: The system is designed to optimize power consumption, ensuring long battery life for the smart door lock.
7. L293D Motor Driver: The L293D motor driver is chosen for its ability to control the DC motor used in the door lock mechanism. It provides bi-directional control and current amplification necessary for smooth and reliable operation.
8. HC-05 Bluetooth Module: The HC-05 Bluetooth module enables wireless communication between the Arduino and the mobile app. It offers a stable and secure Bluetooth connection, allowing users to control the door lock from a distance.
9. Custom Mobile Application: The team has developed a custom mobile application tailored to the smart door lock system. The app provides a user-friendly interface for controlling and monitoring the lock, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience.
